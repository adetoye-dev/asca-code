"""acsa_engine.py — one entry point for the whole Python engine.

The app shells out to Python for its backend, and an end user cannot be assumed
to have an interpreter: macOS no longer ships a usable one and Windows ships
none. This module is the single entry point, so the engine can be frozen into a
self-contained binary:

    acsa-engine db settings.get '{}'
    acsa-engine index --project-root ... --json
    acsa-engine git status '{}'
    acsa-engine pty

It is equally the development entry point (`python3 core-engine/acsa_engine.py
manager …`), so the freeze adds a packaging step rather than a second code path.
