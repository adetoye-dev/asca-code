"""support.py — one file to attach to a bug report.

The app sends no telemetry, so when something goes wrong the user has to be able
to hand over the evidence themselves. This collects it in one place: versions,
paths, row counts, the settings that are *not* secret, and the crash log.

Three deliberate omissions, because a support bundle is exactly the file people
paste into a public issue:

* **No credential values.** The `secrets` table is counted, never read.
* **No chat history.** Prompts and file contents live there.
* **No environment dump.** It would carry every API key in the shell.

Settings are still run through the crash-log redactor before being written, so a
key that was pasted into a settings *value* does not slip out that way.

Paths are shortened to `~` before they are written. A support bundle is a public
artifact, and the settings carry absolute project paths — `~/work/api` says as
much about the bug as `/Users/ada/work/api` does, without naming the machine's
owner.

Reached as `acsa-engine support bundle <path>`.
