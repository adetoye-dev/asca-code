# Freeze the Python engine into the single binary the desktop app ships.
#
# Why: the app's backend is Python, and macOS no longer ships a usable
# interpreter while Windows ships none, so on a clean machine nothing worked.
# `acsa-engine` bundles the engine, the standard library and a Python runtime
# into one executable, so the app needs nothing installed.
#
# Usage:  scripts/build_engine_sidecar.sh
# Output: .tauri/engine/acsa-engine/acsa-engine  (an onedir tree, shipped as a resource)
#
# Tauri resolves `externalBin` entries by that triple suffix and strips it when
# bundling, so the app looks for a plain `acsa-engine` next to its executable.

# `skill_loader` resolves the built-in skills relative to its own file, so the
# markdown has to travel with it — otherwise the frozen engine reports an empty
# skill catalog and the marketplace looks broken in the packaged app.

# The dispatcher imports its entry points dynamically, so they are declared
# explicitly; PyInstaller's static analysis cannot see them.
# `--onedir`, not `--onefile`: onefile writes a NEW executable to a temp directory on
# every launch, so macOS scans a fresh binary every time. Measured on this machine:
# 8.5s per call warm, versus 0.06s for a stable onedir binary — the cost of a scan,
# not of unpacking (the payload is only 14 MB). Since every IPC call spawns the
# engine, onefile made the whole app feel broken.
