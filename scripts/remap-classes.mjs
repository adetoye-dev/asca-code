/**
 * Repo-wide class remaps, in one place so they can be reviewed and gated.
 *
 * Group 1 moves the hand-written sizes onto the scale.
 * Group 2 fixes contrast: "muted" grey was 3.67:1 on the app's lightest surface,
 * and the dense type scale is 9-11px, which needs the full 4.5 rather than the
 * 3.0 large text is allowed.
 *
 * The UI had 402 arbitrary font sizes and a scattering of arbitrary radii. They
 * are not wrong, they are just unrelated: `text-[11px]` and `text-[10px]` and
 * `text-[13px]` were each typed by hand, so nothing could be adjusted together.
 *
 * Every mapping here is **exactly the same pixel value under a name** — the
 * scale steps in `tailwind.config.js` are size-only for the same reason an
 * arbitrary `text-[11px]` is: no line-height is set either way. This script
 * therefore cannot change how anything looks, which is what makes it safe to run
 * across the whole tree in one go.
 *
 * Two values are deliberately left alone: `text-[12.5px]` (2 uses) has no step
 * on the scale, and inventing one for two call sites is how the sprawl started.
 *
 * Idempotent: running it twice does nothing the second time.
