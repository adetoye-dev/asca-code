const SKILL_CODE_REVIEW = `# Code Review

Review the code you are given as a meticulous senior engineer.

Focus, in order:
1. Correctness bugs, off-by-one errors, wrong comparisons, unhandled edge cases.
2. Error handling: swallowed exceptions, missing validation, unsafe assumptions.
3. Security: injection, unsafe deserialisation, secrets in source, unsafe file/network access.
4. Concurrency and resource leaks (unclosed handles, unbounded growth).
5. Naming, dead code, and duplication that hurts maintenance.

For every finding give: the file and line, the concrete problem, and a specific fix.
Prefer the smallest change that fixes the real problem. Never rewrite a whole file
when a focused edit is enough.`;

const SKILL_SECURITY_AUDIT = `# Security Audit

Audit the target code for exploitable weaknesses:
- Input handling: injection (SQL/command/template), path traversal, SSRF.
- Unsafe primitives: eval/exec/pickle, shell=True, unsanitised HTML.
- Secrets: hardcoded keys/tokens, credentials in logs.
- AuthZ/AuthN gaps, missing rate limits, permissive CORS.
- Dependency risk from unpinned or abandoned packages.

Report each issue with severity (critical/high/medium/low), the exact location,
a minimal proof of exploitability, and a concrete remediation. Rank by exploitability
against the actual entry points, not by theoretical severity alone.`;

const SKILL_DESIGN_REVIEW = `# Design Review

Evaluate interfaces and UI for clarity and usability:
- Visual hierarchy: is the primary action obvious? Are metrics labelled with units?
- Consistency: spacing, typography and colour used the same way across screens.
- Accessibility: contrast, focus states, keyboard reachability, screen-reader labels.
- Empty, loading and error states for every data-driven surface.
- Copy: specific, active voice, no filler.

Give prioritised, actionable changes; reference the component and line.`;

const SKILL_REFACTOR_PLAN = `# Refactor Plan

When asked to refactor:
1. State the concrete pain the refactor removes (coupling, duplication, unclear ownership).
2. Define the target shape before touching code.
3. Plan the change in small, independently verifiable steps.
4. Preserve behaviour: keep public interfaces stable unless explicitly told otherwise.
5. After each step, run the project's verification command.

Never mix a refactor with a behaviour change in the same step.`;

const SKILL_TEST_WRITER = `# Test Writer

Write tests that would actually catch regressions:
- One behaviour per test, named for the behaviour, not the implementation.
- Cover the happy path, boundaries (empty, max, off-by-one) and error paths.
- Prefer real objects to mocks; mock only I/O boundaries.
- Assert on observable outcomes, not internal calls.
- Reproduce any reported bug with a failing test before fixing it.

Use the project's existing test framework and conventions.`;

const SKILL_MEMORY_KEEPER = `# Memory Keeper

Maintain durable project memory.

After any non-trivial decision, append a concise entry to the project memory file
(.acsa/memory.md) with: date, decision, the alternatives considered, and the reason.
Before starting work, read that file so prior decisions are respected.

Keep entries short and factual. Never record secrets or credentials.`;

const SKILL_DOCS_WRITER = `# Docs Writer

Produce documentation a new engineer can act on:
- Lead with what the component does and when to use it.
- Show a minimal working example before exhaustive detail.
- Document inputs, outputs, errors and side effects precisely.
- Keep prose in the present tense and avoid marketing language.
- Update the README or the nearest existing doc rather than creating a parallel one.`;

const SKILL_PERF_TUNER = `# Performance Tuner

Optimise measured hot paths only:
1. Establish a baseline (time it, or count calls) before changing anything.
2. Identify the real bottleneck; do not guess.
3. Prefer algorithmic fixes over micro-optimisations.
4. Cache only where invalidation is provably correct.
5. Re-measure and report the before/after numbers.

Never trade correctness for speed.`;
