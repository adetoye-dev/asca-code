/**
 * LazySurface — a Suspense boundary that admits when its surface is late.
 *
 * `Suspense` covers one failure and not the other. A chunk that *fails* to load
 * rejects its `import()`, which throws during render and is caught by the app's
 * error boundary. A chunk that *stalls* — the request neither completes nor
 * fails — leaves the fallback on screen forever, with no error, no timeout and
 * nothing to click.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical: it is what the packaged app did, sitting on "Loading
 * editor…" indefinitely, and the only clue was that the fallback never changed.
 *
 * The note does *not* replace the surface. The chunk keeps loading underneath
 * and the note disappears by itself if the surface arrives — that matters,
 * because a slow load and a stuck one look identical from here and only one of
 * them needs the user to do anything. There is deliberately no "try again": a
 * re-import cannot be forced, since the browser serves the second `import()` of
 * the same specifier from the fetch that is already pending. Reloading the
 * webview is the only thing that actually clears a stalled request.
